  bio: >
    My research interests are in areas of urban geography, feminist and critical race studies, and social action research. I have approached these broad and interconnected fields through theoretically informed, empirical research examining how urban and economic processes construct, and are constructed by relations of power and inequality. I am particularly interested in the barriers that poor women of various ethnic/”racial” groups experience, and the individual and collective survival strategies that they employ, in attempting to support themselves and their families. And, because I am interested in social change, and the role of academics and research in this process, she has utilized social action research as part of a broader feminist methodology. My primary research contributions have been to offer alternative theoretical and methodological approaches to study the intersection of gender, racism, and space to further our understanding of labor markets, urban poverty, community organizing and digital inequalities. My current research examines the relationships among access to information and communication technology (ICT), poor women’s economic opportunities, and poor people’s community-based organizing from a feminist geographical perspective. This research focuses on the relationships among access to information and communication technologies (ICTs); economic, educational, and health disparities; and poor people’s community-based organizing in the United States. My research has been supported by the Fulbright Commission, the National Science Foundation, and the Social Science Research Council. My research has been published in journals such as the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, the Professional Geographer, Urban Geography, Geoforum, Transactions in GIS, and Information, Communication & Society. I received my PhD (1994) and MA (1991) from the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University and a MA (1988) in Urban and Regional Studies from the University of Sussex. I currently serve as Chair of the Department of Geography and Urban Studies and Director of the Greater Philadelphia Women’s Studies Consortium. I am serving a term as Treasurer and National Councillor of the Association of American Geographers and serve on the editorial boards of Urban Geography and Geographical Review. I have served as president of the Geographical Perspectives on Women Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers and received the 2011 Jan Monk Service Award for contributions to the advancement of women and feminist geography in the discipline and the broader public. I have also worked with a number of community organizations related to economic empowerment and digital inequalities. I am currently Vice President of the Board of Directors of the Lower Merion School District in suburban Philadelphia and a former member of the Montgomery County Planning Commission Board in Pennsylvania.

  bio: >
    I am an Assistant Professor of Instruction in Temple University’s Department of Geography & Urban Studies, and the Assistant Director of the Professional Science Master’s in Geographic Information Systems, where I coordinate curriculum, advise students, and teach introductory and advanced courses in GIS. I worked as a database and software developer for 11 years before beginning graduate studies in GIS and geography. My research is broadly concerned with applying geospatial technologies to urban and demographic analysis. My teaching and research heavily emphasize the use of free and open source software. Technological projects in spatial database design and geovisualization are motivated by my use of demographic and economic data to address substantive questions in residential location, sprawl, spatial inequality, racial segregation, and spatial justice. My research investigates the Tiebout model, the theory that households will “vote with their feet” to move to the local government that best matches their preferences for local public services. In published research I have shown that in areas with incongruent school and municipal boundaries, municipalities are stronger “containers” for income segregation than school districts. I am extending this into an investigation of differences in segregation and inequality between regions where municipal and school district borders are congruent and those where they are not. A recent project investigates scale and spatiality in measures of segregation. Segregation measures are heavily influenced by the shapes and sizes of the population enumeration units. While segregation is an inherently spatial phenomenon, commonly used segregation measures such as the index of dissimilarity are oddly aspatial. In response, geographers have proposed spatially adjusted local and global measures of segregation. My research continues in this vein. Overall my teaching, research, and outreach are motivated by a deep love of cities, and an interest in all aspects of their functioning. I am lucky to be working in an era where access to data is increasingly open. I support the use of open data to increase civic engagement including crucial citizen interventions in urban planning and policy. I am active in local technology organizations, and invite inquiries from community and civic groups interested in learning how to apply open data and free software to their questions and needs.

    I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Geography and Urban Studies at Temple University and a member of Fox Chase Cancer Center’s Cancer Prevention and Control program. I am a medical geographer, and my research and teaching focus on the intersection between geography, public health and epidemiology. My research focuses on describing and understanding place-based and geographic disparities in health and disease, with a specific emphasis on applied geographic methods and the role geographic factors play on cancer outcomes and prevention. I am especially interested in the interactions between socioeconomic, demographic and neighborhood environmental factors that influence human health and disease and how we can measure these factors to better understand various health outcomes. Much of the innovation in my work has been through using novel geographic methods and creating new national data sets to answer questions that are directly relevant to understanding and reducing health disparities in cancer. In the past several years, I have both led and worked with interdisciplinary teams of researchers on several high-impact projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society and Susan G. Komen.  Some of the findings from these studies have been published in prominent journals, and some garnered national attention and have been highlighted by the NCI and major media outlets, including the New York Times, CBS, the Guardian and Reuters.  Most recently, I received funding from the NSF Geography and Spatial Sciences Program on a project that combines approaches in geospatial methods and life course epidemiology.  I am also Co-PI on a NSF award under their new Innovations in Graduate Education track of the NSF Research Traineeship program for implementing a collaborative partnership between the Departments of Geography and Urban Studies and Biology at Temple.  My most recent publication was an article in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention that was one of the first studies to examine the role of both individual and geographic factors on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake. I received a B.S. in Geography from Salisbury University and an M.A. in Geography from Towson University. At McGill University, I earned my Ph.D. in Geography and completed a post-doctoral fellowship in epidemiology before spending several years as a research scientist at the New Jersey Department of Health and as associate director of the New Jersey State Cancer Registry.  Prior to joining the faculty at Temple, I served on the faculty at the University of Utah (Department of Geography) and at the Rutgers University School of Public Health (Department of Epidemiology).

    I am a geographer specializing in Geographic Information Science. I received a B.A. in Environmental Geology from the University of California Santa Cruz in 1992, a M.S. in Geography from Portland State University in 1997, and a Ph.D. in Geography from Pennsylvania State University in 2001.  I am certified as a GIS Professional (GISP) by the GIS Certification Institute (GISCI). My research has spanned a number of topical areas, including spatiotemporal data modeling and analysis, environmental justice, and dasymetric mapping. Recently, I have become involved in several projects funded by NIJ and NIH revolving around modeling contextual geographic and social network effects on human behavior, particularly relating to substance use and crime. Of interest are the ways in which social and peer influences on behavior are embedded within place, and how such contextual influences may interact with characteristics of the individual to produce particular behavioral outcomes, such as criminal recidivism and substance use.  Interdisciplinary approaches are a key component of such research, and I have benefited substantially from collaboration with colleagues in psychology, psychiatry, criminal justice, computer science, and statistics on these projects. I currently serve as Research Committee Chair for the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science (UCGIS) and on the Editorial Boards of Geography Compass, Urban and Regional Information Systems Association (URISA) Journal, and Journal of Spatial Information Science. Previously, I have served on the Board of Directors of UCGIS, as Secretary and on the Board of Directors for GISCI (GIS Certification Institute), as Chair of the Association of American Geographers (AAG) Geographic Information Systems and Science Specialty Group (GISS-SG), as Academic Councilor of the AAG Cartography Specialty Group (CSG), and on the Editorial Board of Annals of the Association of American Geographers.

    My research falls at the intersection of environmental and human geography and planning. I am an Assistant Professor of Instruction at the Geography and Urban Studies department at Temple University and received my doctoral degree from The Graduate Center at The City University of New York. I focus on research that explores human-environment interaction through environmental perception and policy, identity, and planning. My work in the past has focused on the impacts of environmental policy and the production of urban space through greening policies. I am interested in environmental inequity and restoration, and how this process is shifting as a result of changing urban landscapes. My research interests include: environmental and human geography, urban-regional dynamics, urban political ecology, city and identity, environmental inequity, perception, and health, planning, water resources, environmental gentrification and displacement, brownfields, and waterfront redevelopment. I have also held planning positions in the past, including environmental, sustainability, and transportation planning positions. I feel my research benefits from having performed these roles in the past.

    My research employs critical theories of power and resistance to look at the evolving geographies of transportation and mobility systems. Recently, my research has brought me to Myanmar (Burma) and to Arunachal Pradesh, India, to look at the use of trained elephants for transportation in forested areas. I’ve also written about the politicized decline of canal transport in Britain, Ireland and Canada, and about the relationship between urban deindustrialization and urban transportation planning in New York City during the mid-20th century. My research frequently makes use of qualitative mapping techniques and thematic geovisualization. I collect and write about paper maps, especially those that portray relationships between landscape, mobility, and power in inventive, stimulating or provocative ways.

  bio: >
    I am interested in promoting resilient and sustainable interactions between people and nature. In my research, I develop remote sensing methods and products to characterize human transformations of landscapes. I combine these products and other spatial information with spatio-temporal statistical models to understand the relative and synergistic effects of landscape transformations and climate variability on environmental changes. My current research includes the characterization of commodity cropland expansion and the influence of agricultural conversion and other land cover changes and climate variability on fire susceptibility and water integrity in Colombia and Peru. I am also interested in understanding the influence of current and projected agricultural investments, people’s urban-rural mobility and climate on land cover changes and socio-ecological vulnerability and resilience in post-conflict regions. I have a master’s degree in Geography from Clark University and a Ph.D. in Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology from Columbia University.
