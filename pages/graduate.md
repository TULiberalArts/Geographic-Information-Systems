Our _Professional Science Master’s in Geographic Information Systems (PSM in GIS)_ is a one-year, 30-credit professional degree designed to allow students to enter or return to the work force quickly. This program is open to all students with an interest in GIS who have already completed a Bachelor’s degree in any field.

Among the top 10 most employable skills of 2017 according to LinkedIn, our curriculum includes:

- data presentation
- mobile development
- statistical analysis and data mining

Our curriculum prepares students for the demands of the job market, integrating advanced technical training with business ethics and professional development. Core coursework includes spatial database design, application development, technical cartography, advanced statistics, and ethics and professional practice, culminating in a hands-on capstone experience. The program trains competitive, skilled GIS technicians and prepares students to sit for the GISP certification exam. We are affiliated with the National Professional Science Master’s Association and work with an advisory board of professionals in the field to ensure that our program is teaching the skills that employers are seeking.

Our 12-credit _Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)_ is open to all students who have completed an undergraduate degree — including current Temple graduate students and those not currently enrolled in a graduate program.

Students interested in completing the certificate must take GUS 5062: Fundamentals of GIS or GUS 8067: Spatial Database Design and three from the list below:

GUS 5061: Cartographic Production
GUS 5063: Remote Sensing
GUS 5065: Urban GIS
GUS 5066: Environmental GIS
GUS 5067: GIS and Location Analysis
GUS 5068: Census Analysis and GIS
GUS 5069: GIS for Health Data Analysis
GUS 5072: Advanced Remote Sensing
GUS 5073: Geovisualization
GUS 5162: Advanced Statistics for Urban Applications
GUS 8065: Cartographic Design
GUS 8066: Application Development for GIS
GUS 8067: Spatial Database Design
GUS 8068: Web Mapping and Map Servers
GUS 5000: Special Topics (one special topics elective with a focus on spatial analysis)
Any course within the range of  GUS 5030-5040 or 8060-8070
GUS 8067: Spatial Data Base Design is required if the equivalent to GUS 5062. Fundamentals of GIS has already been taken at any level or the student has equivalent industry experience. We work with students to determine if they should be waived from the GUS 5062 requirement.
