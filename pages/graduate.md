## PSM in GIS
Our Professional Science Master’s in Geographic Information Systems (PSM in GIS) is a one-year, 30-credit professional degree designed to allow students to enter or return to the work force quickly. This program is open to all students with an interest in GIS who have already completed a bachelor's degree in any field.

Among the top 10 most employable skills of 2017 according to LinkedIn, our curriculum integrates data presentation, mobile development and statistical analysis and data mining. We prepare students for the demands of the job market, integrating advanced technical training with business ethics and professional development. Core coursework includes spatial database design, application development, technical cartography, advanced statistics, and ethics and professional practice, culminating in a hands-on capstone experience. The program trains competitive, skilled GIS technicians and prepares students to sit for the GISP certification exam. We are affiliated with the National Professional Science Master’s Association and work with an advisory board of professionals in the field to ensure that our program is teaching the skills that employers are seeking.
