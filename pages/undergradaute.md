The Department of Geography and Urban Studies offers a four-course certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS is anything that combines data with maps.  Because it is so widely applicable, Geographic Information has become one of the linchpins of the Information Age. Geospatial technology is considered a high-growth industry by the U.S. Department of Labor and employers are seeking candidates trained in geospatial technologies. Its uses are so pervasive in modern industry that the market is growing at an annual rate of almost 35 percent, with faster than average job growth expected over the next ten years.

Training in GIS will give you the skills you need to take on advanced research positions in technology-based companies, governmental agencies, and non-profit organizations. A variety of industries hire people with this important skill set, including public health, the environment, business, technology, city planning, education, design, criminal justice, sociology, communications, journalism, and engineering.

This certificate is open to students in all majors across all colleges and schools at Temple University.
