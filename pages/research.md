## Research Projects
Geography and Urban Studies faculty research projects focus broadly on the interconnections among processes of globalization, the implications for sustainability, and the impact on equity and social justice. Selected research projects with a spatial analysis focus are included below.

**Integrating Satellite Earth Observations for biodiversity decision making in Colombia[(Victor H. Gutierrez-Velez](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/gutierrez-velez-victor-hugo)**<br>
**Funding:** [NASA](https://cce.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/bio/pi_list.pl?project_group_id=3863)<br>

The project aims to integrate Earth Observations from multiple satellite sources to contribute with information for decision-making in biodiversity planning and management in Colombia. We are developing a Decision Support System to help characterizing biodiversity status, drivers of biodiversity change, biodiversity change scenarios and priority areas for biodiversity sampling and monitoring.

**Domesticated Elephants and Monsoon-Time Transportation in South and Southeast Asia [(Jacob Shell)](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/shell-jacob)**

This research project focuses on Burmese and northeast Indian forest communities which train Asian elephants as a means of transportation. Up through the current decade, trained elephants have figured as an important option for humans seeking mobility across geographic zones which are prohibitive of wheeled vehicles. Elephant-based transportation becomes especially important during the flooding season, when roads are obstructed. This dual-species form of mobility endures in the overlapping Kachin, Hkamti, Moran, and Adi ethnic areas of the Indo-Burmese borderlands. Combining ethnographic fieldwork and archival work, the research project evaluates the potential advantages of these practices from political, ecological, and conservation [standpoints](https://carbonmade-media.accelerator.net/33236169;600x450.webp).

**Gentrification and Green Space Development in Philadelphia [(Hamil Pearsall)](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/pearsall-hamil)**
Dr. Hamil Pearsall is the Principal Investigator on a project examining gentrification impacts associated with the creation of 15 new parks in Philadelphia since 2008. Learn more about [Dr. Pearsall’s work](https://sites.temple.edu/hpearsall/).

**A Simulation Platform to Enhance Infrastructure and Community Resilience to Extreme Heat Events [(Ariane Middel)](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/middel-ariane)**<br>
**Funding:** National Science Foundation<br>
**Faculty Affiliated:** Mikhail Chester (ASU, PI), Ariane Middel (Temple University, Co-PI), David Hondula (ASU, Co-PI), and David Eisenman (UCLA, Co-PI)<br>

Exposure to heat is a growing public health concern in many cities across the globe. In the US, Southwest cities have experienced increasing numbers of heat waves in the past few decades, and global climate models project significant increases in both the duration and intensity of these extreme events. Facing these challenges, very little is known about how people are exposed to heat during their day-to- day activities as they interact with urban infrastructure. To understand exposure, factors including the types of homes people live in (and whether they have and use air conditioning), their mobility choices, the quality of the infrastructure (e.g., shading, landscaping, and material choice), their work situation (e.g., air-conditioned office versus outdoor worker), and their activity profiles must be considered. A systematic framework that any city can use to understand how people are exposed to heat and proactively mitigate risk is needed. To create insight into how people are exposed to heat, this work will develop an Urban Activity Heat Simulation (UAHS) platform that will join (1) a model of residential and workplace exposure, (2) travel simulations for automobile use, public transit, and biking/walking, (3) urban infrastructure characteristics, (4) high-resolution urban climate data, and (5) a model of exposure thresholds. UAHS will be developed using Phoenix, Arizona and Los Angeles, California as case studies.

**Social-Spatial Risk and Protective Mechanisms in Urban Adolescent Substance Use [(Jeremy Mennis)](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/mennis-jeremy)**<br>
**Funding:** National Institute of Health and National Institute of Drug Abuse<br>

In this study, we propose to collect survey, real-time location, and ecological momentary assessment data over a two year period in a sample of 300 urban adolescents. This unique data set will then be applied to developing multilevel and actor-based social network models of the co-evolution of substance use behaviors, peer affiliations, and the use and meaning of geographical space over time. We propose a highly contextually specific research approach to ground social networks within the social environment of adolescents' lives. We will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) methodology via mobile messaging technology to simultaneously assess multiple influences on adolescent substance use in real time. Along with sampled specific coordinate data of location and a series of standard surveys, this approach will integrate the personal, social, and environmental processes associated with initiation and escalation of substance use. The goal of this study is to model the evolution of multi-level mechanisms affecting substance use for urban youth. The design gives rise to two related models; (1) a hierarchical three-level longitudinal design, with individual change in substance use nested within personal networks, which are in turn nested within neighborhoods, and also (2) a non-hierarchical design with individuals non-uniquely linked to locations. The latter is best thought of as a bipartite (or 2-mode) social network, i.e., a network with two distinct types of vertices, in this case "locations" and "individuals", where ties are only allowed between vertex types. Aim 1. Model changes in substance use over 2 years, focusing on the moderating effects of individual social network quality (risk/protection) on neighborhood-level predictors (concentrated disadvantage: low education and employment, high public assistance; drug related crime; alcohol availability).Aim 2. Model changes in substance use over 2 years, focusing on the mediating effects of individual network quality (riskiness) on individual-level predictors: affective, cognitive and behavioral influences. Aim 3. Model change over two years in the co-evolution of substance use and the use of space, defined by a bipartite social network linking individuals to locations, particularly focusing on: (a) Structural tendencies driven by common influence and selection-related mechanisms (e.g. bipartite-graph equivalents of transitivity, reciprocity and other network closure effects typically found in ordinary (1-mode) networks), (b) Main and moderating effects of activity spaces (individuals' interpretation of locations), and (c) Main and moderating effects of neighborhood characteristics (which are properties of locations).
